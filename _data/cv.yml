- title: Profile Summary
  type: text
  contents: As a PhD candidate, my research combines expertise in data science, machine learning, and large language models to address stereotype leakage and bias in AI-generated user representations, particularly for marginalized communities. I develop demographically accurate and culturally grounded personas using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks and open-source LLMs. My work emphasizes inclusive data collection, rigorous evaluation methodologies, and ethical frameworks, ensuring that AI systems authentically represent underrepresented groups and align with the principles of responsible AI.
