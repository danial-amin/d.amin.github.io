I am a <a>doctoral student</a> at the University of Vaasa, Finland, focusing on <a>Generative AI (GenAI) and user representation research</a>. Tandemly, I work as an AI Research Scientist at <a>Samsung Design Innovation Center in France</a>, developing GenAI tools that help designers create more representative products. Previously, I have led AI teams at several companies and collaborated with the Government of Pakistan on complex engineering systems. I have a background in engineering and have earned multiple degrees in data science and business from institutions like <a>MIT</a> and UC San Diego.

My research centers on making <a>GenAI systems fairer and more inclusive</a> towards representation of users. I study how GenAI creates user personas and work to reduce bias, especially for <a>marginalized communities</a>. I use large language models and NLP to build better representations of different groups of people. My goal is ensuring GenAI systems don't perpetuate stereotypes. I also explore how GenAI can be used responsibly in design and decision-making.

I speak four languages: English, Urdu, Punjabi, and some (petit :)) French. I enjoy writing poetry and dark prose. When I am not working, I'm probably <a>overthinking or cooking</a>. I have been involved in space education programs in Pakistan for many years, helping to organize events such as World Space Week. I enjoy <a>mentoring startups</a> and helping them ethically utilize GenAI.
