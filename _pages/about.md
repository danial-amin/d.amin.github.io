I am a doctoral student at the University of Vaasa, Finland, where I focus on Generative AI and user representation research. Tandemly, I work as an AI Research Scientist at Samsung Design Innovation Center in France, where I develop GenAI tools that help designers create more representative products. Previously, I have led AI teams at several companies and collaborated with the Government of Pakistan on complex engineering systems. I have a background in aerospace engineering and have earned multiple degrees in data science and business from institutions like MIT and University of California, San Diego.

My research centers on making Generative AI systems fairer and more inclusive towards representation of users. I study how GenAI creates user personas and work to reduce bias, especially for marginalized communities. I use large language models and NLP to build better representations of different groups of people. My goal is to ensure GenAI systems don't perpetuate stereotypes. I also explore how GenAI can be used responsibly in design and decision-making. I have published numerous research papers on AI ethics, persona development, and bias detection in AI systems.

I speak four languages: English, Urdu, Punjabi, and some (petit :)) French. I enjoy writing poetry and dark prose. When I am not working, I am probably overthinking or cooking. I have been involved in space education programs in Pakistan for many years, helping to organize events such as World Space Week. I enjoy mentoring startups and helping them ethically utilize Generative AI. When I'm not working on research, I volunteer at various educational programs and speak at conferences about ethical AI topics.
