This isn’t an abstract critique—it’s based on real observations from the ground about data flows, labor practices, and whose voices shape AI development.</p> <p>Over the past seven years, I’ve had the privilege of working on AI projects across multiple continents—from aerospace applications in Pakistan to startup ecosystems in Ireland, from enterprise solutions in the Caribbean to design innovation in France. What I’ve observed isn’t the democratizing force that AI advocates often promise, but a more complex reality where the benefits and burdens of AI development are unevenly distributed.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The current AI ecosystem doesn't just have bias problems—it has structural inequality problems that go far deeper than algorithmic fairness. </div> <p>This post reflects on what I’ve learned about the global AI ecosystem and raises questions we need to address as the technology becomes more pervasive.</p> <h2 id="the-data-extraction-reality">The Data Extraction Reality</h2> <p>During my time leading data science teams at various organizations, I’ve seen how data flows in the global AI economy. When we built analytics frameworks for enterprise clients, the pattern was consistent: data generated in emerging markets often gets processed and monetized by platforms headquartered elsewhere<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p> <div class="data-flow-diagram"> Lagos User Data → Silicon Valley AI Company → Licensed Back to Lagos Banks </div> <p>Take mobile financial services, an area I’ve worked on extensively. While innovations like M-Pesa originated in Kenya<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the behavioral data generated by millions of users across Africa increasingly flows to Western AI companies building credit scoring and fraud detection systems. The insights derived from this data—understanding spending patterns, predicting financial behavior, optimizing user interfaces—become intellectual property that’s then licensed back to local financial institutions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p> <p>This isn’t inherently problematic, but it raises questions about value distribution. When a startup in Silicon Valley uses transaction data from Lagos to improve their algorithm, who benefits from that improvement? Usually, it’s the shareholders of the Silicon Valley company, not the Lagos users whose behavior created the training data.</p> <d-footnote>This pattern mirrors historical resource extraction, where raw materials were shipped from colonies to metropolitan centers for processing, then sold back as finished goods.</d-footnote> <h2 id="the-invisible-workforce">The Invisible Workforce</h2> <p>Through platforms like Omdena, where I led machine learning projects for social impact, I regularly worked with data scientists and ML engineers from across the Global South. The talent and dedication were extraordinary, but the economic dynamics were troubling.</p> <p>The global AI workforce structure reveals concerning patterns about how labor and profits are distributed:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-workforce-flow.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <p>Many of the data annotation and model training tasks that make AI systems possible are outsourced to countries where labor costs are lower<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. I’ve seen brilliant engineers in Pakistan, India, and the Philippines working on cutting-edge AI projects for a fraction of what their counterparts in Silicon Valley earn for similar work.</p> <p>Content moderation—the essential but traumatic work of training AI systems to recognize harmful content—is disproportionately performed by workers in Kenya, the Philippines, and other countries where Western tech companies can hire talent cheaply<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These workers face significant psychological risks while protecting users in wealthier countries from disturbing content.</p> <h2 id="language-and-cultural-bias-in-practice">Language and Cultural Bias in Practice</h2> <p>While building LLM-based solutions like <strong>Bob-The Startup Advisor</strong> and <strong>Sandy-The Financial Advisor</strong>, I encountered the limitations of current AI models firsthand. Despite claims of multilingual capability, these systems struggle with non-English contexts in ways that go beyond simple translation.</p> <p>Large language models trained primarily on English text exhibit systematic biases when dealing with non-Western concepts<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. When I tested financial advisory models with questions about Islamic banking principles or traditional business practices common in South Asian markets, the responses were often inadequate or culturally inappropriate.</p> <details><summary>Example: Testing Cultural Context</summary> <p>When I asked my financial advisor LLM about <em>hawala</em> (traditional Islamic money transfer), it provided generic responses about “informal banking” without understanding the cultural and religious principles that make hawala a legitimate and important financial instrument in many communities.</p> </details> <p>This isn’t just a technical limitation—it reflects whose knowledge and perspectives are valued in AI training data. The vast majority of text used to train large language models comes from English-language sources, primarily from Western contexts<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Local knowledge systems, indigenous practices, and non-Western ways of organizing information are systematically underrepresented.</p> <h2 id="the-innovation-periphery">The Innovation Periphery</h2> <p>One of the most frustrating aspects of the current AI ecosystem is how innovation is perceived and valued. During my MBA at Rennes School of Business, I studied how technological innovation is often framed as flowing from “centers” (Silicon Valley, Boston, London) to “peripheries” (everywhere else).</p> <p>The following chart illustrates how AI investment is concentrated in wealthy regions:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-investment-distribution.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <p>This framing ignores the reality I’ve witnessed: incredible innovation happening across the Global South, often out of necessity rather than venture capital abundance. The aerospace projects I worked on in Pakistan involved sophisticated optimization algorithms developed under resource constraints that would be unimaginable in Western tech companies.</p> <p>Yet these innovations rarely receive global recognition or investment. The AI research emerging from universities in Nigeria, Pakistan, Brazil, or India is often overlooked by major conferences and journals, which maintain editorial boards dominated by Western institutions<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p> <h2 id="a-more-nuanced-path-forward">A More Nuanced Path Forward</h2> <p>I’m not arguing that all AI development should be localized or that global collaboration is inherently problematic. The projects I’ve worked on have benefited enormously from international collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p> <p>But we need more honest conversations about power dynamics in AI development. Some concrete steps that could help:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Equitable Partnership Models</strong>: When AI companies use data from emerging markets, they should share the value created, not just extract insights<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diverse Training Data</strong>: Deliberate efforts to include non-Western knowledge sources in AI training data, with proper compensation and attribution to source communities<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Local AI Capacity Building</strong>: Investment in AI research institutions and startups in the Global South, not just outsourcing implementation work<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ethical Labor Practices</strong>: Fair compensation and psychological support for workers performing essential but difficult AI training tasks<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The following chart compares current AI value distribution with a more equitable proposed model:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-value-distribution.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <h2 id="questions-for-the-ai-community">Questions for the AI Community</h2> <p>As someone who has worked across this ecosystem, I’m left with questions that the AI community needs to address:</p> <ul> <li>How do we ensure that AI development serves local needs rather than just global markets?</li> <li>What does equitable participation in the AI economy actually look like?</li> <li>How can we preserve cultural diversity while benefiting from AI’s connective potential?</li> <li>Who should have control over AI systems that affect millions of people?</li> </ul> <p>These aren’t abstract philosophical questions—they’re practical challenges that will determine whether AI becomes a force for reducing or increasing global inequality.</p> <p>The technology itself is remarkable. I’ve seen AI systems optimize supply chains, predict equipment failures, and automate routine tasks in ways that genuinely improve people’s lives. But technology alone doesn’t determine outcomes—the economic and social structures around it do.</p> <p>As AI practitioners, we have a responsibility to think critically about these structures and work toward more equitable alternatives. The future of AI isn’t predetermined, but it won’t democratize itself.</p> <div class="author-bio"> <strong>About the Author:</strong> Danial Amin is an AI Tech Lead currently working on generative AI solutions for design optimization at Samsung Design Innovation Center in France.

As Bommasani et al. (2021) note in their landmark paper on foundation models, “The generality of foundation models creates challenges for reliability, as these models may appear competent when they are not.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This observation highlights a critical limitation in our current approach to AI development.</p> <div class="research-highlight"> <strong>Research Finding:</strong> A recent Gartner survey found that 45% of organizations are already using generative AI, but many report challenges with accuracy and reliability in specialized contexts[^2]. </div> <p>This underscores a fundamental challenge: generalist models struggle to maintain deep expertise across diverse domains, creating a breadth-depth tradeoff that limits their effectiveness in specialized applications.</p> <p>The following diagram illustrates the current limitations of generalized AI systems:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/generalist-vs-specialist.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <h2 id="persona-as-a-framework-for-specialized-ai">Persona as a Framework for Specialized AI</h2> <p>The concept of “persona” offers a promising framework for developing specialized AI systems with distinct capabilities and areas of expertise. Rather than viewing AI as a monolithic system, a persona-driven approach creates specialized AI agents designed for specific domains and use cases.</p> <p>Research from Shen et al.

However, these models have inherent limitations in their knowledge and capabilities. Three key techniques have emerged over the time to address these limitations and extend LLM capabilities: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and prompt engineering.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <strong>Core Challenge:</strong> While LLMs possess remarkable general capabilities, they face temporal, domain, and contextual boundaries that limit their effectiveness in specialized applications. The solution lies in strategic enhancement techniques that address these specific limitations. </div> <p>This comprehensive guide explores each approach, their purposes, and how they compare in extending LLM capabilities beyond their inherent constraints.</p> <h2 id="retrieval-augmented-generation-rag">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h2> <p>RAG enhances LLMs by connecting them to external knowledge sources, enabling them to access information beyond their training data.</p> <h3 id="how-rag-works">How RAG Works</h3> <div class="technique-diagram"> ┌─────────────────┐

asks a question, RAG searches an external knowledge base for relevant information.</p> <p><strong>Context Integration</strong>: The retrieved information is provided to the LLM as additional context.</p> <p><strong>Augmented Generation</strong>: The LLM uses this additional context alongside its internal knowledge to generate a response.</p> <h3 id="why-rag-matters">Why RAG Matters</h3> <div class="comparison-highlight"> <strong>Addressing Temporal and Domain Boundaries:</strong> RAG directly addresses the temporal and domain boundary limitations by connecting LLMs to up-to-date information sources. </div> <p>RAG enables models to:</p> <ul> <li>Provide answers based on current information beyond their training cutoff</li> <li>Access specialized knowledge in domains where the model lacks depth</li> <li>Cite specific sources, increasing response reliability and transparency</li> </ul> <h2 id="finetuning">Finetuning</h2> <p>Finetuning adapts pre-trained LLMs to specific domains, tasks, or styles by additional training on specialized datasets.</p> <h3 id="how-finetuning-works">How Finetuning Works</h3> <div class="technique-box"> <strong>Process Overview:</strong> Transform general-purpose models into domain specialists through targeted training </div> <p><strong>Starting Point</strong>: Begin with a pre-trained LLM that has general knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Additional Training</strong>: Continue training the model on carefully selected datasets relevant to the target domain or task.</p> <p><strong>Parameter Adjustment</strong>: The model’s parameters are adjusted to optimize performance for the specific application.</p> <h3 id="why-finetuning-matters">Why Finetuning Matters</h3> <p>Finetuning addresses the domain boundary challenges by:</p> <ul> <li>Deepening the model’s expertise in specific knowledge areas</li> <li>Teaching the model to follow particular formats, styles, or processes</li> <li>Aligning the model’s outputs with specific organizational requirements or values</li> <li>Improving performance on specialized tasks like medical diagnosis or legal analysis</li> </ul> <h2 id="prompt-engineering">Prompt Engineering</h2> <p>Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions to guide LLM behavior and outputs.</p> <h3 id="how-prompt-engineering-works">How Prompt Engineering Works</h3> <div class="technique-box"> <strong>Approach:</strong> Strategic instruction design to optimize model performance without modification </div> <p><strong>Instruction Design</strong>: Carefully crafting the wording, structure, and guidance given to the LLM</p> <p><strong>Context Framing</strong>: Providing relevant background information and setting the stage for the response</p> <p><strong>Response Shaping</strong>: Using techniques like few-shot examples or specific formatting requirements</p> <h3 id="why-prompt-engineering-matters">Why Prompt Engineering Matters</h3> <p>Prompt engineering addresses contextual boundaries by:</p> <ul> <li>Helping models understand the specific requirements of a task</li> <li>Guiding models to produce outputs in desired formats or styles</li> <li>Encouraging more thorough reasoning or specific analytical approaches</li> <li>Improving response consistency and reliability without changing the model itself</li> </ul> <h2 id="similarities-between-the-approaches">Similarities Between the Approaches</h2> <p>All three techniques share important commonalities:</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Enhancement</strong>: Each approach helps LLMs overcome inherent knowledge limitations, though through different mechanisms.</p> <p><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: All three aim to improve the quality, relevance, and reliability of LLM outputs.</p> <p><strong>Specialization</strong>: Each technique allows for adapting general-purpose LLMs to more specialized applications.</p> <p><strong>Boundary Management</strong>: All address the challenge of knowledge boundaries described in contemporary LLM research.</p> <h2 id="key-differences">Key Differences</h2> <p>Despite their similarities, these approaches differ significantly:</p> <p><strong>Implementation Complexity</strong>: Prompt engineering requires minimal technical infrastructure, while RAG needs retrieval systems and finetuning requires substantial computational resources.</p> <p><strong>Model Modification</strong>: Finetuning changes the model’s parameters, RAG adds external components, and prompt engineering works with the model as-is.</p> <p><strong>Adaptability</strong>: Prompt engineering offers the highest flexibility for quick adjustments, RAG allows dynamic knowledge updates, and finetuning provides deep but less flexible specialization.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Recency</strong>: RAG provides the most current information access, prompt engineering can incorporate recent context, and finetuning is limited to training data vintage.</p> <h2 id="choosing-the-right-approach">Choosing the Right Approach</h2> <p>The optimal approach depends on specific requirements:</p> <div class="comparison-highlight"> <strong>Decision Framework:</strong> Select techniques based on your specific needs, resources, and constraints </div> <p><strong>Use RAG when</strong>: You need access to current information, specialized documents, or want to ensure factual accuracy with citations.</p> <p><strong>Use finetuning when</strong>: You need deep specialization in a particular domain, consistent adherence to specific patterns, or improved performance on specialized tasks.</p> <p><strong>Use prompt engineering when</strong>: You need flexibility, have limited technical resources, or want to quickly adapt how the model responds without changing its underlying capabilities.</p> <p><strong>Use combinations when</strong>: Most real-world applications benefit from combined approaches, such as using prompt engineering with a finetuned model connected to a RAG system.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>RAG, finetuning, and prompt engineering represent complementary approaches to extending LLM capabilities and addressing their inherent knowledge boundaries. While each approach has its strengths and limitations, they all contribute to making LLMs more useful, reliable, and applicable to real-world problems.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <strong>Future Perspective:</strong> As these technologies continue to evolve, we can expect even more sophisticated ways to enhance LLM performance and overcome their limitations through strategic combination of these techniques. </div> <p>Understanding these techniques is essential for organizations looking to deploy LLMs effectively. By selecting the right approach—or combination of approaches—for specific use cases, organizations can maximize the value of these powerful AI tools while managing their limitations appropriately.</p> <hr/> <p><em>How has your experience been with these LLM enhancement techniques?

Now, Google Research’s new paper “Titans: Learning to Memorize at Test Time” may represent a similar watershed moment, addressing the fundamental scaling limitations that have plagued current LLM architectures.</p> <div class="breakthrough-highlight"> <strong>Architectural Revolution:</strong> Just as Transformers made self-attention the dominant paradigm, Titans suggests that learned memorization – where models actively decide what's worth remembering – may become the new architectural foundation for the next generation of large language models. </div> <p>This analysis explores how Titans could fundamentally reshape the landscape of foundation model development and deployment.</p> <h2 id="the-industrys-context-length-problem">The Industry’s Context Length Problem</h2> <p>For AI companies and researchers building foundation models, context length has become the central bottleneck that constrains real-world applications and drives massive computational costs.</p> <h3 id="the-current-scaling-crisis">The Current Scaling Crisis</h3> <div class="technical-comparison"> <strong>The Impossible Tradeoff:</strong> Current architectures force developers to choose between computational efficiency and modeling capability, limiting practical deployment options. </div> <p>Major AI labs have invested enormous resources into extending context windows, with GPT-4 reaching 128K tokens and Claude pushing to 200K. But these extensions come with significant computational costs due to the quadratic scaling properties of attention mechanisms.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the market demands even longer contexts for enterprise applications that need models capable of processing entire codebases, legal documents, or scientific papers.
