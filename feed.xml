This isn’t an abstract critique—it’s based on real observations from the ground about data flows, labor practices, and whose voices shape AI development.</p> <p>Over the past seven years, I’ve had the privilege of working on AI projects across multiple continents—from aerospace applications in Pakistan to startup ecosystems in Ireland, from enterprise solutions in the Caribbean to design innovation in France. What I’ve observed isn’t the democratizing force that AI advocates often promise, but a more complex reality where the benefits and burdens of AI development are unevenly distributed.</p> <div class="key-insight"> <strong>Key Insight:</strong> The current AI ecosystem doesn't just have bias problems—it has structural inequality problems that go far deeper than algorithmic fairness. </div> <p>This post reflects on what I’ve learned about the global AI ecosystem and raises questions we need to address as the technology becomes more pervasive.</p> <h2 id="the-data-extraction-reality">The Data Extraction Reality</h2> <p>During my time leading data science teams at various organizations, I’ve seen how data flows in the global AI economy. When we built analytics frameworks for enterprise clients, the pattern was consistent: data generated in emerging markets often gets processed and monetized by platforms headquartered elsewhere<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p> <div class="data-flow-diagram"> Lagos User Data → Silicon Valley AI Company → Licensed Back to Lagos Banks </div> <p>Take mobile financial services, an area I’ve worked on extensively. While innovations like M-Pesa originated in Kenya<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, the behavioral data generated by millions of users across Africa increasingly flows to Western AI companies building credit scoring and fraud detection systems. The insights derived from this data—understanding spending patterns, predicting financial behavior, optimizing user interfaces—become intellectual property that’s then licensed back to local financial institutions<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p> <p>This isn’t inherently problematic, but it raises questions about value distribution. When a startup in Silicon Valley uses transaction data from Lagos to improve their algorithm, who benefits from that improvement? Usually, it’s the shareholders of the Silicon Valley company, not the Lagos users whose behavior created the training data.</p> <d-footnote>This pattern mirrors historical resource extraction, where raw materials were shipped from colonies to metropolitan centers for processing, then sold back as finished goods.</d-footnote> <h2 id="the-invisible-workforce">The Invisible Workforce</h2> <p>Through platforms like Omdena, where I led machine learning projects for social impact, I regularly worked with data scientists and ML engineers from across the Global South. The talent and dedication were extraordinary, but the economic dynamics were troubling.</p> <p>The global AI workforce structure reveals concerning patterns about how labor and profits are distributed:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-workforce-flow.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <p>Many of the data annotation and model training tasks that make AI systems possible are outsourced to countries where labor costs are lower<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. I’ve seen brilliant engineers in Pakistan, India, and the Philippines working on cutting-edge AI projects for a fraction of what their counterparts in Silicon Valley earn for similar work.</p> <p>Content moderation—the essential but traumatic work of training AI systems to recognize harmful content—is disproportionately performed by workers in Kenya, the Philippines, and other countries where Western tech companies can hire talent cheaply<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. These workers face significant psychological risks while protecting users in wealthier countries from disturbing content.</p> <h2 id="language-and-cultural-bias-in-practice">Language and Cultural Bias in Practice</h2> <p>While building LLM-based solutions like <strong>Bob-The Startup Advisor</strong> and <strong>Sandy-The Financial Advisor</strong>, I encountered the limitations of current AI models firsthand. Despite claims of multilingual capability, these systems struggle with non-English contexts in ways that go beyond simple translation.</p> <p>Large language models trained primarily on English text exhibit systematic biases when dealing with non-Western concepts<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>. When I tested financial advisory models with questions about Islamic banking principles or traditional business practices common in South Asian markets, the responses were often inadequate or culturally inappropriate.</p> <details><summary>Example: Testing Cultural Context</summary> <p>When I asked my financial advisor LLM about <em>hawala</em> (traditional Islamic money transfer), it provided generic responses about “informal banking” without understanding the cultural and religious principles that make hawala a legitimate and important financial instrument in many communities.</p> </details> <p>This isn’t just a technical limitation—it reflects whose knowledge and perspectives are valued in AI training data. The vast majority of text used to train large language models comes from English-language sources, primarily from Western contexts<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. Local knowledge systems, indigenous practices, and non-Western ways of organizing information are systematically underrepresented.</p> <h2 id="the-innovation-periphery">The Innovation Periphery</h2> <p>One of the most frustrating aspects of the current AI ecosystem is how innovation is perceived and valued. During my MBA at Rennes School of Business, I studied how technological innovation is often framed as flowing from “centers” (Silicon Valley, Boston, London) to “peripheries” (everywhere else).</p> <p>The following chart illustrates how AI investment is concentrated in wealthy regions:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-investment-distribution.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <p>This framing ignores the reality I’ve witnessed: incredible innovation happening across the Global South, often out of necessity rather than venture capital abundance. The aerospace projects I worked on in Pakistan involved sophisticated optimization algorithms developed under resource constraints that would be unimaginable in Western tech companies.</p> <p>Yet these innovations rarely receive global recognition or investment. The AI research emerging from universities in Nigeria, Pakistan, Brazil, or India is often overlooked by major conferences and journals, which maintain editorial boards dominated by Western institutions<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</p> <h2 id="a-more-nuanced-path-forward">A More Nuanced Path Forward</h2> <p>I’m not arguing that all AI development should be localized or that global collaboration is inherently problematic. The projects I’ve worked on have benefited enormously from international collaboration and knowledge sharing.</p> <p>But we need more honest conversations about power dynamics in AI development. Some concrete steps that could help:</p> <ol> <li> <p><strong>Equitable Partnership Models</strong>: When AI companies use data from emerging markets, they should share the value created, not just extract insights<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Diverse Training Data</strong>: Deliberate efforts to include non-Western knowledge sources in AI training data, with proper compensation and attribution to source communities<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Local AI Capacity Building</strong>: Investment in AI research institutions and startups in the Global South, not just outsourcing implementation work<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup>.</p> </li> <li> <p><strong>Ethical Labor Practices</strong>: Fair compensation and psychological support for workers performing essential but difficult AI training tasks<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>The following chart compares current AI value distribution with a more equitable proposed model:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/ai-value-distribution.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <h2 id="questions-for-the-ai-community">Questions for the AI Community</h2> <p>As someone who has worked across this ecosystem, I’m left with questions that the AI community needs to address:</p> <ul> <li>How do we ensure that AI development serves local needs rather than just global markets?</li> <li>What does equitable participation in the AI economy actually look like?</li> <li>How can we preserve cultural diversity while benefiting from AI’s connective potential?</li> <li>Who should have control over AI systems that affect millions of people?</li> </ul> <p>These aren’t abstract philosophical questions—they’re practical challenges that will determine whether AI becomes a force for reducing or increasing global inequality.</p> <p>The technology itself is remarkable. I’ve seen AI systems optimize supply chains, predict equipment failures, and automate routine tasks in ways that genuinely improve people’s lives. But technology alone doesn’t determine outcomes—the economic and social structures around it do.</p> <p>As AI practitioners, we have a responsibility to think critically about these structures and work toward more equitable alternatives. The future of AI isn’t predetermined, but it won’t democratize itself.</p> <div class="author-bio"> <strong>About the Author:</strong> Danial Amin is an AI Tech Lead currently working on generative AI solutions for design optimization at Samsung Design Innovation Center in France.

As Bommasani et al. (2021) note in their landmark paper on foundation models, “The generality of foundation models creates challenges for reliability, as these models may appear competent when they are not.”<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This observation highlights a critical limitation in our current approach to AI development.</p> <div class="research-highlight"> <strong>Research Finding:</strong> A recent Gartner survey found that 45% of organizations are already using generative AI, but many report challenges with accuracy and reliability in specialized contexts[^2]. </div> <p>This underscores a fundamental challenge: generalist models struggle to maintain deep expertise across diverse domains, creating a breadth-depth tradeoff that limits their effectiveness in specialized applications.</p> <p>The following diagram illustrates the current limitations of generalized AI systems:</p> <div class="l-body"> <iframe src="/assets/plotly/generalist-vs-specialist.html" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" height="400px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe> </div> <h2 id="persona-as-a-framework-for-specialized-ai">Persona as a Framework for Specialized AI</h2> <p>The concept of “persona” offers a promising framework for developing specialized AI systems with distinct capabilities and areas of expertise. Rather than viewing AI as a monolithic system, a persona-driven approach creates specialized AI agents designed for specific domains and use cases.</p> <p>Research from Shen et al.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
